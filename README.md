# Network-Traffic-Analysis

## Introduction
In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding how to monitor and analyze network traffic is a fundamental skill. This lab serves as a practical demonstration of tcpdump and Wireshark, two indispensable tools for network analysis. This lab is designed to showcase their capabilities through a controller creative scenario. The following outlines capturing, saving, and analyzing network traffic, with an emphasis on how these tools apply to real-world cybersecurity challenges.  

The setup consists of a small, virtualized network consisting of three virtual machines (VMs): a Kali Linux VM for capturing and analyzing traffic, a Windows 10 VM, and an Ubuntu Linux VM hosting network services. This setup allows to simulate diverse traffic scenarios and provides meaningful data for analysis.

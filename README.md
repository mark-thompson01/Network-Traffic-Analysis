# Network-Traffic-Analysis

## Introduction
In the realm of network security, understanding how to monitor and analyze network traffic is a fundamental skill. This lab serves as a practical demonstration of tcpdump and Wireshark, two indispensable tools for network analysis. This lab is designed to showcase their capabilities through a controlled creative scenario. The following outlines capturing, saving, and analyzing network traffic, with an emphasis on how these tools apply to real-world cybersecurity challenges.  

The setup consists of a small, virtualized network consisting of two virtual machines (VMs): a Kali Linux VM for capturing and analyzing traffic, and a Ubuntu Linux VM. This setup allows to simulate diverse traffic scenarios and provides meaningful data for analysis.  

## Lab Objectives
The primary goals of this lab are: 

1. To introduce key tcpdump commands and demonstrate how to capture specific types of traffic.  

2. To generate and examine diverse network traffic, including simulated malicious activity.

3. To save captured traffic to a file for further inspection using Wireshark.   

## Lab Setup
The lab environment consists of two interconnected VMs:

> **Kali Linux VM:** Used for generating traffic with hping and capturing traffic with tcpdump and analyzing it with Wireshark.   
> **Ubuntu Linux VM:** Used as the simulated target to practice on with ports 22 and 80 open. 

These machines are connected via a virtual network to ensure controlled and reproducible results.

# Network-Traffic-Analysis

## Introduction
In the realm of cybersecurity, understanding how to monitor and analyze network traffic is a fundamental skill. This lab serves as a practical demonstration of tcpdump and Wireshark, two indispensable tools for network analysis. This lab is designed to showcase their capabilities through a controller creative scenario. The following outlines capturing, saving, and analyzing network traffic, with an emphasis on how these tools apply to real-world cybersecurity challenges.  

The setup consists of a small, virtualized network consisting of three virtual machines (VMs): a Kali Linux VM for capturing and analyzing traffic, a Windows 10 VM, and an Ubuntu Linux VM hosting network services. This setup allows to simulate diverse traffic scenarios and provides meaningful data for analysis.  

## What is tcpdump?
Tcpdump is a command-line tool used to capture and analyze network traffic. It acts metaphorically as a powerful magnifying glass, allowing us to filter and observe data packets as they are traversing through a network medium. Tcpdump is a highly customizable command and forms the backbone of many network analysis workflows, particularly in cybersecurity. Itâ€™s versatility and ability to save traffic for later analysis make it invaluable for professionals working to secure computer networks. 

## Lab Objectives
The primary goals of this lab are: 

1. To introduce key tcpdump commands and demonstrate how to capture specific types of traffic.  

2. To save captured traffic to a file for further inspection using Wireshark.  

3. To analyze captured traffic and uncover insights relevant to cybersecurity scenarios.  

4. To generate and examine diverse network traffic, including simulated malicious activity.

## Lab Setup
The lab environment consists of three interconnected VMs:

> Kali Linux VM: Used for capturing traffic with tcpdump and analyzing it with Wireshark.  
> Windows 10 VM: Generates user activity such as web browsing and file transfers.  
> Ubuntu Linux VM: Hosts an HTTP server and other network services for interaction.

These machines are connected via a virtual network to ensure controlled and reproducible results. 

## Generating Network Traffic
To produce traffic for analysis, traffic is realistically simulated and varied network interactions:

1. Web Browsing:
   > Use a browser or curl oon the Windows 10 VM to access a webpage hosted on the Ubuntu VM.

2. File Transfers via SSH:
   > Establish an SSH session from Kali to Ubuntu and use scp to transfer files. This simulates secure file transfer.

3. Ping Sweeps and Network Scans:
   > Conduct a ping sweep or a network scan from Kali using tools like nmap to identify active hosts. This generates ICMP and SYN packets. 

4. Simulated Malicious Activity:
   > Use tools like hping3 on Kali to create malformed or suspicious packets, mimicking attack patterns.
